## Profile
<p>When the term “big data” became popular in major industries, I became immersed in exploring its great potential to improve people’s daily lives. The modern era is referred to as the “information society,” but I realized that without properly analyzing massive data, the sea of information means nothing. My desire is to extend my knowledge in data science and solve the demanding problems faced by industry and society
</p>
<p>I'm exploring data science field and look forward to learning new methodologies. I'm also interested in the presentation and visualization of data mining results. To become a horizontal data scientist, I'm focusing on designing systems and algorithms to extrapolate knowledge from diverse yet interconnected data sources. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to the development of social infrastructure that will improve the lives of people and encourage social innovation. </p>
